# Technical Technique Presentation Proposal


## Introduction  ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png) 

Brief overview of the presentation topic: 
# Setting Background IMAGES in the PowerBI Reports
- Importance of the technical technique in the assigned domain: __I was assigned to the Team Reporting.__
- Objectives of the presentation: __To present an easy shortcuts to background design of PowerBI dashboard reports.__

##  ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png)  Background
- Current state of technology in the domain: __I am using Power BI Desktop 2.126.1261.0__
- Challenges and opportunities: __Challenge is that I wished to create a *.json file with script to automatically set my theme background image to every page in my dashboard report. It seams this version does not support that. So I have focused on setting the background with uploading images whitin format page panel where I added some extra visuals.
Also, as BIA professionals we only have a limited time to play with the design when presenting important data so the opportunity lies with knowing how to quickly beautify the presentation.__

## Presentation Candidate   ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png) 
- __Kaja Marinsek W0456542, NSCC student of graduate certificate in Business Intelligence and Analystics__
- Relevant experience and expertise: __A graduate civil engineer from Slovenia with passion for data ;)__

##  ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png)  Sample Data Selection
- Criteria for selecting sample data: __I was drawn to National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts 2023 free Public Data Package when I saw the [beautiful infographic](https://overshoot.footprintnetwork.org/newsroom/country-overshoot-days/) created by Global Footprint Network 2024, www.overshootday.org.__
  
- Sources of sample data: https://www.footprintnetwork.org/licenses/public-data-package-free/
  
- Relevance of the data to the demonstration: __This data is what I will work on my final project, I could demonstrate the technical technique with any background data and image.__

## Technical Technique Demonstration   ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png) 
- Description of the technical technique: __Finding the buttons in the GUI__
- Steps for applying the technique to the sample data:
- __1. Choose any image that you want to use for the background of presentation pages of your dashboard design in Power BI and remember which folder you saved it to.__
-  __2. In the main page of the dashboard go to the side panel calles Visualizations, click on the paper and pencil icon that stands for "Format your report page" and choose Canvas Background.__
- __3. Search for your image.__
- __4. Choose the Image fit and Transparency.
      Alternatively, one can download and add a [custom visuals](https://pragmaticworksonline.sharepoint.com/sites/FileShare/Shared%20Documents/Forms/FileView.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FFileShare%2FShared%20Documents%2FTraining%2FPower%20BI%20Custom%20Visuals%2FCustom%20Visuals&p=true&ga=1) called "Image Viewer" to their Visualizations pannel and work with the urls of the photos...__

- Expected outcomes and benefits: __Pretty and Fun PowerBI Presentation Dashboard.__

##  ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png)   Implementation Plan
- Timeline for the preparation of the presentation: __2 days:__ Presentation Day = T-2
- __DAY 1: Prepare a sample dashboard with data and then choose the photo for the background with color scale. Make sure Power BI is behaving.__
- __DAY 2: Record the 2 minute presentation of the newly acquired skill with OBS and/or present it in person in class.__
- Resources required (software, hardware, etc.): __PC or laptop with PowerBI installed and permission to download images__
- Practice sessions and dry runs: __no need, _ad lib_ is the best.__

## Conclusion   ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png) 
- Summary of what will be achieved with the presentation: __My classmates and anybody watching the video/presentation will know how to quickly change their background and beautify dashboard for their future PowerBI presentations.__
- Call to action for the audience: __Apply it liberally.__

- References to technical literature: Hmm, since it is a visual tool, it is easier to learn watching, hence the links to videos:

   I really wanted for this to work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfonCEjQ13I&t=155s, but for me it unfortunately didn't.

  So I followed this instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzJvTcCedm8&t=97s
