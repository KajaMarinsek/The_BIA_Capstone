Brief overview of the presentation topic: 
# Setting Background IMAGES in the PowerBI Reports
- Importance of the technical technique in the assigned domain: __I was assigned to the Team Reporting.__
- Objectives of the presentation: __To present an easy shortcuts to background design of PowerBI dashboard reports.__

##  ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png)  Background
- Current state of technology in the domain: __I am using Power BI Desktop 2.126.1261.0__
- Challenges and opportunities: __Challenge is that I wished to create a *.json file with scrip to automaticaly set my theme background image to the every page in my dashboard report. It seams this version does notsupport that. So I have focused on setting the background with uploding images whitin format page pannel where I added some extra visuals.
Also, as BIA professionals we only have a limited time to play with the design when presenting important data so the opputunity lies with knowing how to quickly beautify the presentation.__

- Sources of sample data: https://www.footprintnetwork.org/licenses/public-data-package-free/
- Relevance of the data to the demonstration: __This data is what I will work on my final project, I could demonstrate the technical technique with any background data and image.

## Technical Technique Demonstration   ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png) 
- Description of the technical technique: Finding the buttons in the GUI
- Steps for applying the technique to the sample data:

##  ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png)   Implementation Plan
- Timeline for the preparation of the presentation: 3 days, to Prepare a sample dashboard and than choose the photo for the bakcground with color scale.
- Resources required (software, hardware, etc.): PC or laptop with PowerBI installed.
- Practice sessions and dry runs: no need, prima vista is the best.
