Brief overview of the presentation topic: 
# Setting Background IMAGES in the PowerBI Reports
- Importance of the technical technique in the assigned domain: *I was assigned to the Team Reporting.*

##  ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png)  Background
- Current state of technology in the domain: _I am using Power BI Desktop 2.126.1261.0_
- Challenges and opportunities: Challenge is that I wished to create a *.json file with scrip to automaticaly set my theme background image to every page in my dashboard report, but this version does not seam to support that. So i focused on setting the background with uploding images in format page pannel where i added some extra visuals.
Also, as BIA professionals we only have a limited time to play with the design when presenting important data so the , opputunity lies whitin knowing how to quickly beautify the dashboard.
