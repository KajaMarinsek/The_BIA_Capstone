# Business Intelligence Presentation Proposal

## ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICONEarthCalendar.png)    Introduction 
Overview of the business intelligence topic:
 # THE EARTH OVERSHOOT DAY
 ### Earth Overshoot Day is calculated by dividing Earth's biocapacity by man's ecological footprint and multiplying the result by 365 days. Similar calculations are applied on a country-by-country basis to determine Country Overshoot Days each year. [_[1.]World Economic Forum_](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/08/earth-overshoot-day-human-consumption-biocapacity-ecological-footprint/#:~:text=Earth%20Overshoot%20Day%20is%20calculated,Country%20Overshoot%20Days%20each%20year)

- __Significance of data-driven decision-making:__ The whole premise of Earth Overshoot Day is data!
  
        "Ecological FootprintÂ© Explorer open data platform allows anyone to explore and download National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts data. Updated every year, the Accounts track human demand and natureâ€™s capacity to meet that demand for more than 200 countries."
  
  I will explore the data that infulences the longivity of countries and the Earth on the whole.
- __Goals of the presentation:__ I want to learn how the World Overshoot Day is obtained and what parameters are included into the calculations.

- __Name and professional background:__ Kaja Marinsek, 
A graduate civil engineer from Slovenia with passion for data ;)
- __Experience with business intelligence tools and methodologies:__  As NSCC student of graduate certificat in Business Intelligence and Analystics I have become proficient in Excel Power Query, SQL and Python languages, Orange for data analysis and Power BI as presentation tool.


## Data Selection ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/The_BIA_Capstone/blob/main/images/ICONEarthData.png) 
- __Criteria for choosing the dataset:__ I was drawn to National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts 2023 free Public Data Package. I was searching for meaningful data, somthing temporal and with enough features.
- __Potential sources for data acquisition:__ https://www.footprintnetwork.org/licenses/public-data-package-free/
- __Relevance of the chosen data to the business domain:__ It depends on the business I guess... ðŸ¤” But this data is more about health of our planet!

- Relevance of the data to the demonstration: __This data is what I will work on my final project, I could demonstrate the technical technique with any background data and image.__

## ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/The_BIA_Capstone/blob/main/images/ICONEarthBigData.png)  Business Intelligence Techniques Demonstration
- __Overview of the selected business intelligence techniques:__ First I will open the data with Excel, create a model that will help with quick PowerBI dashboard. If the data will require cleaning i will use Python in Jupyter Notebook where we have created a EDA pipeline.
- __Process of applying these techniques to the chosen data:__ There is not a lots of data, from my main source i expext data to be pretty clean and preprocessed. I will focus mainly on model and how was Overshot Day calculated. In my presentation I will compare different Countries and see if get some interesting insights with data analysis.
- __Anticipated insights and their impact on business strategies:__ "There is no planet B"

##   Implementation Plan  ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICONEarthCalendar.png) 
- __Schedule for the development of the presentation:__ 2 weeks
- Week 1: See what data i have and waht can i find. If not sofice search for subplementing data. EDA of data and building a model
- Week 2: Build PowerBI dashboard about findings. Record the presentation and present in class.__
- __Necessary resources (BI tools, datasets, etc.):__ Computer that can handle Excel, SQL Server connection, Jupyter Notebook, PowerBI installed and permission to download images
- __Rehearsals and feedback sessions:__ Again, no need, _ad lib_ is the best.__

##  ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/The_BIA_Capstone/blob/main/images/ICONEarthLightbulb.png)   Conclusion  
- __Recap of the expected contributions of the presentation:__ We will be richer for the knowledge of ecological footprint and how it is calculated and some more stats.
- __Encouragement for audience engagement__ Disscussion on how could Canada's Overshoot day be moved further along in the year, living within the resources and special subtopic on how new technologies are not beeing most resource efficient...
