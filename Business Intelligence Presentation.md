# Business Intelligence Presentation Proposal

## Introduction 
Overview of the business intelligence topic:
 # THE EARTH OVERSHOOT DAY
- Significance of data-driven decision-making: __The whole premise of Earth Overshoot Day is data! "Ecological Footprint© Explorer open data platform allows anyone to explore and download National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts data. Updated every year, the Accounts track human demand and nature’s capacity to meet that demand for more than 200 countries." I will explore the data that infulences the longivity of countries and the Earth on the whole.__
- Goals of the presentation: __I want to learn how the World Overshoot Day is obtaines and what parameters are included into the consideration.__

Brief overview of the presentation topic: 
# Earth Overshoot Day is calculated by dividing Earth's biocapacity by man's ecological footprint and multiplying the result by 365 days. Similar calculations are applied on a country-by-country basis to determine Country Overshoot Days each year.

Setting Background IMAGES in the PowerBI Reports
- Importance of the technical technique in the assigned domain: __I was assigned to the Team Reporting.__
- Objectives of the presentation: __To present an easy shortcuts to background design of PowerBI dashboard reports.__

##  ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png)  Background
- Current state of technology in the domain: __I am using Power BI Desktop 2.126.1261.0__
- Challenges and opportunities: __Challenge is that I wished to create a *.json file with scrip to automaticaly set my theme background image to the every page in my dashboard report. It seams this version does notsupport that. So I have focused on setting the background with uploding images whitin format page pannel where I added some extra visuals.
Also, as BIA professionals we only have a limited time to play with the design when presenting important data so the opputunity lies with knowing how to quickly beautify the presentation.__

## Presentation Candidate   ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png) 
- __Kaja Marinsek W0456542, NSCC student of graduate certificat in Business Intelligence and Analystics__
- Relevant experience and expertise: __A graduate civil engineer from Slovenia with passion for data ;)__

##  ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png)  Sample Data Selection
- Criteria for selecting sample data: __I was drawn to National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts 2023 free Public Data Package when I saw the beautiful infographic created by Global Footprint Network 2024, www.overshootday.org.__
- Sources of sample data: https://www.footprintnetwork.org/licenses/public-data-package-free/
- Relevance of the data to the demonstration: __This data is what I will work on my final project, I could demonstrate the technical technique with any background data and image.__

## Technical Technique Demonstration   ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png) 
- Description of the technical technique: __Finding the buttons in the GUI__
- Steps for applying the technique to the sample data:
- __1. Choose any image that you want to use for the background of presentation pages of your dashboard design in Power BI and remeber which folder you saved it to.__
-  __2. In the main page of the dashboard got to the side pannel calles Visualizations, chose paper and pencil icon that stands for "Format your report page" chose Canvas Background.__
- __3. Search for your image.__
- __4. Choose the Image fit and Transparency.
      Alternatively, one can download and add a new visual called "Image Viewer" to their Visualizations pannel and works with the urls of the photos...__

- Expected outcomes and benefits: __Pretty and Fun PowerBI Presentation Dashboard.__

##  ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png)   Implementation Plan
- Timeline for the preparation of the presentation: __2 days:__
- __DAY 1: Prepare a sample dashboard with data and than choose the photo for the bakcground with color scale.__
- __DAY 2: Record the 2 minute presentation of the newly acquired skill with OBS and/or present in person in class.__
- Resources required (software, hardware, etc.): __PC or laptop with PowerBI installed and permission to download images__
- Practice sessions and dry runs: __no need, _ad lib_ is the best.__

## Conclusion   ![image](https://github.com/KajaMarinsek/Presentation-DOCS/blob/main/images/ICON_cogwheel.png) 
- Summary of what will be achieved with the presentation: __My classemates and anybody watching the video/presentation will know how to quickly change their background and beautify dashboard for their future PowerBI presentations.__
- Call to action for the audience: __Apply it liberally.__
